# SWING
Language is pascal based java graphics library where it makes it easy for 
the person coding to implement graphics with very few statements

This language constructs the base procedures, functions, if statement, and for 
loop, and in addition to that we also have 5 other statements that contribute to 
graphic

Sample Programs are given, as Hello.sw and Hello2.sw

The compiler generates JVM code, so you would need Jasmine to run the Assembly code
